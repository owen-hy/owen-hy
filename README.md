## Hi! My name is Owen Yoo

I am a rising senior at the University of Michigan (Go Blue „ÄΩÔ∏è) studying Statistics and Data Science 

My research interests lie in two main fields:

1) Statistical Methods for Public Health üíä

I am currently interested in developing and applying statistical methods to better understand the relationship that humans have with complex health issues. Within statistical methods, I am interested in Causal Inference and Bayesian Methods.
Within applications, I am primarily interested in applications to oncology, mental health, and wearable devices.

2) Sports Performance Analytics for American Football üèà

Current innovation in football, including player tracking and advanced metrics, has allowed for the rise of football analytics (Think moneyball ... but for football). With a team sport so intricate and complex as football, special considerations
should be kept in mind with the interpretation and consideration of statistical methods. My interest lies in modeling to evaluate team and player efficacy, and the interpretability for these methods.
